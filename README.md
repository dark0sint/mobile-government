# M-Government Platform for Kabupaten Bandung

## Overview
This is a prototype Mobile-Government (M-Government) platform providing access to public services at the Kabupaten Bandung level. It simulates key services like citizen registration, tax payments, health bookings, and complaints. **This is for educational purposes onlyâ€”do not use in production without legal compliance and security audits.**

**Note on "Dark OSINT"**: Dark OSINT refers to advanced open-source intelligence techniques that operate in less visible or "dark web"-adjacent spaces for data collection. This project does NOT incorporate or endorse dark OSINT methods, as they can violate privacy laws (e.g., UU PDP in Indonesia). Use only ethical OSINT for research, such as public government APIs.
